Angular Multicomplete
================

A simple Angular directive that allows selection of multiple items. 
It's been customized to be suitable for some of my projects but it's easy to customize so it may be useful for other people as well.

Currently there are no documentation but you can view the examples at http://artturisipila.github.io/AngularMultiComplete/
